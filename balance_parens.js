/* 
  Today, we learned about stacks and queues. You'll have to use one of these data structures to answer the following question:

  Create a function that will return true if a string contains balanced parentheses. 

  sample input: balanceParens("(())")
  sample output: true

  sample input: balanceParens("()()")
  sample output: true

  sample input: balanceParens("()(")
  sample output: false

  (What's the relevance? Imagine how an interpreter knows that this is a syntax error: function() {)
*/

var balanceParens = function(string) {
  // your solution goes here	
};

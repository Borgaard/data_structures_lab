/* 
  Today, we learned about singly-linked lists. To challenge your understanding of this data structure, try to solve the following problem:

  Create a function that will return the node located n-positions from the end of a list.
  
  sample 
  list.add("one");
  list.add("two");
  list.add("three");
  list.add("four");  

  sample input: list.nodeFromTail(0)
  sample output: {data: "four", next: null}

  sample input: list.nodeFromTail(1)
  sample output: {data: "two", next: null}
*/

var nodeFromTail = function(index) {
  // your solution goes here	
};
